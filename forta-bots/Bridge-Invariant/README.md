# Bridge Invariant Monitor

## Description

### On L1:

The bot monitors the bridge invariant across the L2 Networks.

The invariant is:

```
L1DAI.balanceOf(escrow) â‰¥ L2DAI.totalSupply()
```

### On L2:

The bot detects DAI `totalSupply` changes.

## Configuration

> The file `src/constants.ts` contains all the variables needed by the bot.
>
> - `L2_DATA`: Contains the L2 networks with the `chainId` number and their respective `l1Escrow` address.
> - `CONFIG` contains:
>   - `DAI`: DAI address.
> - `L2_MONITOR_HASH`: Hash of the bot.
>
> **NOTE**: Before deploying, set the `L2_MONITOR_HASH` and the `agentId` in `forta.config.json` to the same random keccak256 hash.
