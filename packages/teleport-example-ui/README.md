# Teleport Example UI

This repository provides an example UI that illustrates how a front-end can be built on on top of
[teleport-sdk](https://github.com/makerdao/xdomain/tree/master/packages/teleport-sdk).

**This is an example UI and is not meant for use in production. This frontend is unaudited and may contain critical bugs
resulting in the loss of your funds. Use at your own risks!**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
